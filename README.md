# Rust Samples

## What is it?

A collection of Rust code samples, "translated" from samples in other languages, found on the Internet or in books.

## Why?

As I'm learning Rust, I find it difficult to memorize all the concepts without practicing _a lot_.

_The Rust Programming Language_ is a great book, available both [online](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or as [print book / ebook](https://nostarch.com/Rust2018).

However, my manner of learning things isn't really aligned with how that book introduces things. As a comparison, I find [The C Programming Language](https://www.pearson.com/store/p/c-programming-language/P100001672033/9780131103627) (aka the K&R), [Learn C The Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/), [The Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/) much more didactical, because they include a ton of exercises at every step.

In order to remedy that, I figured I should try and learn Rust by following the same method as applied in the aforementioned books.
