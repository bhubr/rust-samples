# Rust Samples

## What is it?

A collection of Rust code samples, "translated" from samples in other languages, found on the Internet or in books.

## Why?

As I'm learning Rust, I find it difficult to memorize all the concepts without practicing _a lot_.

_The Rust Programming Language_ is a great book, available both [online](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or as [print book / ebook](https://nostarch.com/Rust2018).

However, my manner of learning things isn't really aligned with how that book introduces things. As a comparison, I find these textbooks much more didactical, because they include a ton of exercises at every step:

* [The C Programming Language](https://www.pearson.com/store/p/c-programming-language/P100001672033/9780131103627) (aka the _K&R_),
* [Learn C The Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/) (aka _LCTHW_),
* [The Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/) (aka _GOPL_)

I also found this book (which is not a language reference, but a problems/project repository) useful:

* [Classic Computer Science Problems in Java](https://www.manning.com/books/classic-computer-science-problems-in-java) (aka _CCSPJ_)

In order to remedy the lack of practical examples in _TRPL_, I figured I should try and learn Rust by following the same method as applied in the aforementioned books.
